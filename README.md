## Technologies
Key technologies that have been implemented:
* Model-View-ViewModel pattern implemented that helps cleanly separate an application's business and presentation logic from its user interface (UI)
* WPF data binding provides a connection between the app UI and the data it displays. When the data changes its value, the elements that are bound to the data reflect changes automatically
* The WPF grid system had been used to provide flexible placement of UI elements
* Data serialization/deserialization using Json library for storing user goals
